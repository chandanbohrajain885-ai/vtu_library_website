        "designSummary": "This brand identity features a classic and authoritative visual style characterized by a strong serif typography paired with a patriotic color palette of deep navy blue, vivid red, and a warm cream background. The design employs a spacious, modular layout with generous negative space, allowing bold headlines and clear calls to action to stand out prominently. Navy blue serves as the primary color for text and backgrounds, conveying professionalism and trust, while red is used strategically for emphasis and interactive elements such as buttons and highlights, adding energy and urgency. The cream background softens the overall contrast, providing warmth and approachability. Typography is elegant and traditional, with large, bold serif headlines that communicate confidence and experience, complemented by smaller serif body text for readability and formality. UI components like buttons are distinctly styled with rounded corners and clear color differentiation between primary and secondary actions. Minimal graphic elements and purposeful iconography maintain a clean, focused aesthetic that supports the brand's serious and results-driven tone. This design language is versatile for any website requiring a professional, trustworthy, and engaging presence.",

Navy blue serves as the primary color for text and backgrounds, conveying professionalism and trust, while red is used strategically for emphasis and interactive elements such as buttons and highlights, adding energy and urgency. The cream background softens the overall contrast, providing warmth and approachability. Typography is elegant and traditional, with large, bold serif headlines that communicate confidence and experience, complemented by smaller serif body text for readability and formality. UI components like buttons are distinctly styled with rounded corners and clear color differentiation between primary and secondary actions. Minimal graphic elements and purposeful iconography maintain a clean, focused aesthetic that supports the brand's serious and results-driven tone. This design language is versatile for any website requiring a professional, trustworthy, and engaging presence.",
